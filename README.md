# Anagram Solver
## A script that given any letters and the length of the word can generate a list of all possible combiniations that have definitions.

### Installation
Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install the following modules.

```bash
pip install pyenchant
```

### Improvements To be Made:

~~1. Ability to choose to keep words that have no definitions~~ (Done 12/18/2020)
~~2. Check for special character (input handling)~~ (Done 12/18/2020)
3. Option to create all words up to length
